                            Morrison said in a video conference that Australia's goal is to safeguard national interests and values, while trying to maintain a working relationship with China, according to the website of Australia's New Daily.

                            "Our focus is to establish a dialogue that will enable us to resolve the inter-governmental issues in a stable manner." "That doesn't need to be amplified any further," Morrison said at the time.

                           Morrison also acknowledged the seriousness of Australia's relationship with China, according to the Australian's Chinese website.

                            A day earlier, Australian Prime Minister Morrison had demanded an apology for a Tweet by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian about a cartoon showing Australian troops killing Afghan children, saying it was a "fake" and that China should "feel ashamed”.

                            In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on November 30 that Australian soldiers committed serious crimes in Afghanistan, which was reported by Australian media and confirmed by the investigation report of Australian Defense Department.

These atrocious crimes by The Australian side have been strongly condemned and condemned by the international community.

Earlier, he was asked about zhao lijian's tweet about his painting, which was "hung up" by the Australian prime minister. "Then I'll have time to draw another one tonight," he said.</div>
